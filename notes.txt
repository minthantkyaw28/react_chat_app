-Firebase Docs I used 
https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup?authuser=0&hl=en
https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/password-auth

-For no reason, project console is telling me to add autocomplete attribute to my form inputs.
This is the documentation I read to solve the problem.
https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/create-amazing-password-forms/

-In Registration Form I have 4 inputs 
I console.log the file input value and saw c:\fakepath 
So I checked docs to see c:\fakepath is an error or not.

It is not an error. It is browser safety features for blocking server from accessing local machine disk structure.

According to the specifications of HTML5, 
a file upload control should not reveal the real local path to the file 
you have selected, if you manipulate its value string with JavaScript. 
Instead, the string that is returned by the script, which handles the file 
information is c:\fakepath.

This requirement is already implemented in Internet Explorer 8 
â€“ the real path to the file will be shown only if the page that contains 
the control is added to the trusted sites collection of the browser.

-We can send email and password directly to firebase but we can't send file and name to firebase directly.
email and password are for authentication.

First, initialize auth in firebase

authentication->Sign-in method-> native & additional providers.
For the sake of this project, Email/password native provider is relatable.
Enable it and save.

After enabled auth from firebase our code start working 
when i sign up i get all userCredential by consoling out.
Additional thing I gained is ... Firebase hashed the password.

This is how auth with email and password works.
There is one thing left, How do we send image/file and name/string to firebase ?

I refered this docs for above mentioned issue.
https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/web/upload-files

By default, a Cloud Storage bucket requires Firebase Authentication to perform 
any action on the bucket's data or files. You can change your Firebase Security Rules 
for Cloud Storage to allow unauthenticated access. Since Firebase and your project's 
default App Engine app share this bucket, configuring public access may make newly 
uploaded App Engine files publicly accessible, as well. Be sure to restrict access to your 
Cloud Storage bucket again when you set up Authentication.

We have to go to cloud storage first and enable it.

This is chat app, I am not alone I can register I can find people.
So Authentication and Fire Store is not enough we need to store user data in firestore database.
